Note: I like to use YYMMDD format for dates

Rev. 11/28/2021
- most recent [ dated :( ] entry on 211019
- A big gap in the data occurred when I traded cars with another person and stopped logging my gas.
- I've started recording the oil level eyeballed from the dipstick. This is entered as a decimal from 0 to 1.
- also added a comment column
